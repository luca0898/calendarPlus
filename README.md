# Calendar-Plus

This project was a school project that I developed in 2015 with the help of a team of colleagues.
Basically it is an software to organize a massage clinic and it had the advantage of generating a clinical follow-up document for the patient.

The final version was lost, but I managed to recover a prototype version and put it in the ``.\old_project`` folder

The purpose of this repository is to rewrite this project so that I can test my progress over the past few years.
